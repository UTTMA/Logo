# UTTMA Logo #

The logo for [Project UTTMA](https://github.com/UTTMA):

<img src="https://uttma.github.io/Logo/Rendered/UTTMA%20Logo.svg" alt="A stylized cyan cube, with an orange 'U' shape at its bottom, outlined in a thick eggshell white border. Almost all corners are rounded except the top corners of the 'U' shape, which are sharp angles." width="256" />


## For Using ##

Feel free to use the UTTMA logo! You just gotta keep to the terms of [the license](https://github.com/UTTMA/Logo/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). Don't worry, there's an actually-easy-to-read section at the top ðŸ˜‰

Also, though you don't strictly have to, it'd be nice if you kept your use of this logo to stuff related to [Project UTTMA](https://github.com/UTTMA).
